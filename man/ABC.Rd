\title{Area between the CIF curves for competing risk data}
\description{
Statistical inference of area between the CIF curves (ABC) test for competing risk data.
}
\usage{
ABC(time, status, group, t0=0, tau=NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{time}{The followed up time for testing data.}
\item{status}{The status indicator, should be coded as 0= censored, 1= event of interest, 2= all other competing events.}
\item{group}{The group indicator for comparison, and the elements of this vector should take either 0 or 1. Normally, 0= control group, 1= treatment group.}
\item{t0}{The start time point for testing, the default is set as t0=0 for overall test.}
\item{tau}{The truncation time point for testing, which needs to be smaller than or equal to the minimum of the largest observed time in each of the two groups. When tau=NULL, the default value is used. See details in reference.}
}
\value{
\item{t0}{The start time point for testing.}
\item{tau}{The truncation time point for testing.}
\item{delta}{The alsolute difference of two cumulative incidence functions.}
\item{var(delta)}{The variance of delta based on Aalenâ€™s method.}
\item{statistic}{The statistic of this test.}
\item{Pvalue}{The P value of this test.}
